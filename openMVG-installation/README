Linux Debian compilation and installation script for openMVG

This script is available for Debian distros and maybe for other ones using the aptitude mecanism (tested on Debian only)

Its purpose is to automate openMVG compilation and installation under a Debian like distro.

Original script was written by Natanael1234 from https://gist.github.com/Natanael1234/9440452
